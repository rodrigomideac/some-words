My name is Rodrigo Midea Coelho and I am a Staff Software Engineer with 12 years of experience. 

I work at Cobli, a [fleet management company](https://www.cobli.co/) in Brazil, for last 7 years. I code, mentor, and I look for high leverage projects within a 400+ people company that can increase the revenue growth. Writing design docs about company-wide architecture changes is essential to steer the engineering team to meet business demands. Also, I need to mentor juniors and influence several teams to have the buy-in to do high-leverage projects.

From 2015 to 2018 I worked at Nexxto developing an IoT Plataform focused on temperature and humidity sensing, and in 2014 I a short internship at Siemens.

On 2016, I started my Masters degree about Signal Processing on Escola Politécnica da USP - Universidade de São Paulo (EPUSP). I finished on 2021 with a thesis about [Adaptive IIR Diffusion Networks Using Hybrid FIR-IIR Combination](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3142/tde-29042022-083345/en.php). On 2012, an opportunity to study abroad appeared and I spent 2012 and 2013 in Boston, United States at Suffolk University. Before going back to Brazil, I did a research internship at MIT Sea Grant Lab studying turn-off conditions of power SCRs. My IoT background started on 2006, when I begun a electronics technical course over the span of 3 years. I liked programming microcontrollers and electronics, so I chose to pursue Electrical Engineering.

I am the father of two wonderful kids that I love to the deep of my heart. Surprisingly, life didn't teach me how to change a diaper so I had to learn a lot in past couple of years. 

I like woodworking since I we bought a house and I found a way to save 50% for our custom built furniture, so you can expect to see some blog posts about that too.
